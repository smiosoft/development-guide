# Contributing to Assets

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Create a Pull Request

We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes will happen through pull requests; they are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Update the documentation.
3. Create that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
